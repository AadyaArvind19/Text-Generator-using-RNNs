This Text Generator is a Python project that extracts text from websites, processes the content, 
and trains a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. The trained model then 
generates new text based on a given seed input. This tool features an interactive interface built 
with ipywidgets for generating text in real-time.
